By default, the java.net.InetAddress API uses the operating system’s built-in resolver to resolve host names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.


InetAddress ip = InetAddress.getByName("google.com");

This JEP redesign java.net.InetAddress API to use service loader to find the resolver instead of using the operating system’s built-in resolver.

InetAddress.java

  private static InetAddressResolver loadResolver() {
      return ServiceLoader.load(InetAddressResolverProvider.class)
              .findFirst()
              .map(nsp -> nsp.get(builtinConfiguration()))
              .orElse(BUILTIN_RESOLVER);
  }
