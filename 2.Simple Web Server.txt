This provides a command-line tool, jwebserver to start a simple web server to serve static files,
suitable for prototyping, ad-hoc coding, testing, and educational purpose, not for a production server.

By default, the jwebserver starts a simple web server at port 8000, and serves the static files from the current directory that start the command. Furthermore, it serves only HEAD and GET requests, 
and other requests will receive a 501 – Not Implemented or a 405 – Not Allowed response.
